## Introduction
Silhouette Collective is a fashion concierge business that provides a highly personalized shopping experience to each and every customer. We collect personal information from each client, such as their clothing sizes, brand preferences, favorite colors, and item preferences to create a customer profile that is assigned to one of our experienced shoppers within the company. The shopper can then shop for specific events or just singular items per the customerâ€™s request. As a new company, we have decided to perform this analysis to get a feel for our earnings and scope within the market thus far. This analysis offers key insights into our performance across various products, markets nationwide, and earnings by product. We can use these key insights to drive our future business decisions surrounding expansion into more markets, our product offerings, as well as our criteria for selecting clothing. As our stakeholders, we hope this analysis reassures you of our potential as a business and our bright future within the online shopping industry. While we have had many successes, as seen in this analysis there is always room for improvement and we look forward to expanding Silhouette Collective and furthering our success.
<br>
<br>The creation of a Silhouette Collective database gives Silhouette Collective a look into customer insights, process optimization, and data-driven decision-making insights to compete in an increasingly competitive industry and to maximize their company potential. We created a data mart to be able to optimize reporting, archive their data, as well as consolidate their large amount of data.

## Sales Dashboard in Power BI

### Dashboard
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad429715-cf50-42ed-a519-4a55147fcf19)

### Analysis
Sales experienced a steady increase, despite seasonality, from Back-to-Root's opening in February 2018 through September 2019, then a sharp increase was seen in October 2019. Sales hit their peak of $1,273,807.50 in January 2020 before a drastic drop to $147,357 in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated impacts. Back-to-Roots closed for a period and then was only able to offer delivery and pick-up options. Since then, sales have once again been steadily increasing and are projected to continue doing so, although seasonality will result in some increases and decreases in sales.
<br>
<br>Of the Back-to-Roots customers who have disclosed birthdays, most (574) customers fall in the 30-39 age group and make-up $1.32 million of the $17.51 million sales. The data suggests these customers prefer an online order placement method, with 43.9% of orders by customers aged 30-39 placed online (compared to 33.9% for all customers). Similarly, the 490 customers aged 40-49, 446 customers aged 20-29, and 362 customers aged 50-59 place more orders online than in-store or via phone. While all age groups place a percentage of orders in-store, this order placement method is used most often by customers with undisclosed birthdays. This could be because it is easy to input your birthday when placing an online order, and it is less common to disclose birthday information when in-store.
<br>
<br>Of the orders associated with a rewards status (i.e. not placed by customers with no rewards), 45.3% are placed online (compared to 33.9% for all orders) and 39.1% are placed in-store (compared to 51.4% for all orders). Thus, the data suggests that more loyal customers prefer the online order placement method. Further, orders not associated to a reward status have an average order total of $85, while orders associated to the bronze status average $95, associated to silver status average $96, associated to gold status average $93, and associated to platinum status average $94. Thus, the data suggests having a reward status leads to more spending per order, but the level of reward status does not necessarily make a difference.
<br>
<br>The majority of sales are from customers with Boulder and Longmont addresses, likely because there are Back-to-Roots locations in each of these places. There are also some sales from customers in Niwot and Lafayette; however, sales are isolated to customers in these four cities.

### Recommendations
<ul>
  <li>Continue developing, improving, and promoting the online order placement system, as many loyal customers prefer this order placement method.</li>
  <li>Promote rewards program, as it may lead to more spending per order. Further, consider adjusting incentives between rewards tiers to increase spending.</li>
  <li>Market to potential customers in cities surrounding Boulder, Longmont, Niwot, and Lafayette to increase customer base (delivery may be appealing).</li>
</ul>
