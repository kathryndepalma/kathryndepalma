## Introduction
Silhouette Collective is a fashion concierge business that provides a highly personalized shopping experience to each and every customer. We collect personal information from each client, such as their clothing sizes, brand preferences, favorite colors, and item preferences to create a customer profile that is assigned to one of our experienced shoppers within the company. The shopper can then shop for specific events or just singular items per the customerâ€™s request. As a new company, we have decided to perform this analysis to get a feel for our earnings and scope within the market thus far. This analysis offers key insights into our performance across various products, markets nationwide, and earnings by product. We can use these key insights to drive our future business decisions surrounding expansion into more markets, our product offerings, as well as our criteria for selecting clothing. As our stakeholders, we hope this analysis reassures you of our potential as a business and our bright future within the online shopping industry. While we have had many successes, as seen in this analysis there is always room for improvement and we look forward to expanding Silhouette Collective and furthering our success.
<br>
<br>The creation of a Silhouette Collective database gives Silhouette Collective a look into customer insights, process optimization, and data-driven decision-making insights to compete in an increasingly competitive industry and to maximize their company potential. We created a data mart to be able to optimize reporting, archive their data, as well as consolidate their large amount of data.

### Recommendations

1. **Invest More on the East Coast:**
   - Increase marketing efforts in east coast states by gathering customer contact information (e.g., email, text message sign-ups) for targeted campaigns.
   - Conduct annual surveys asking customers what products they want to see, considering regional preferences (e.g., winter items in colder climates).

2. **Address the Profit Drop from August to September:**
   - Implement special deals during these months to boost profit and incentivize customers to begin holiday shopping earlier.
   - Create **fall deals** as clothing companies start transitioning into winter clothing, aligning with seasonal demands.
   - Expand the product offerings to include **more summer clothing** to increase profits at the end of summer/beginning of fall.

3. **Tailor Product Offerings Based on Event Types:**
   - Focus on expanding products for high-revenue Event Types like **Night-General** and **Wedding**.
   - Limit product offerings for low-revenue categories like **Club** and **Day-General**, potentially reducing costs by introducing more affordable products.

4. **Expand Item Selection:**
   - Use customer survey results to identify what products consumers want, and tailor product offerings based on these findings.
   - Regularly assess which items perform best and which need to be adjusted or phased out, ensuring alignment with consumer demands nationwide.
