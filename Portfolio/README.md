### Writing Samples
#### Good Urbanims: Ruby Hill Park
<i>Winter 2025</i>
<br>
<br>In this essay, I explored the concept of a utopian place around Denver, carefully examining its characteristics and envisioning its idealistic features. I translated complex ideas about urban development and community well-being into accessible language for a general audience. This process allowed me to refine my ability to synthesize and present intricate concepts in a way that resonates with readers outside of specialized fields. These skills are valuable in my technical analysis work and in communicating complex data effectuvily to non-technical audiences, ensuring that my insights can be understood and applied.

#### The Global Economy from a Structuralist Perspective
<i>Winter 2024</i>
<br>
<br>In this essay, I analyzed the global economy through a structuralist lens, focusing on how global economic systems and inequalities are shaped by historical and institutional structures. I worked to break down complex economic theories and present them in a way that is digestible for a broader audience. This helped me enhance my ability to communicate sophisticated economic concepts in simpler terms, a skill that is essential both in technical analysis and when explaining intricate subjects to individuals with varying levels of expertise.

### Innovation and Entrepreneurship Living and Learning Community
<i>Fall 2021 - Spring 2022</i>
<br>
<br>The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Living and Learning Community (LLC) is a group of first-year students living and taking academic classes together. I joined this community to help myself integrate into college with a group of people who have similar interests. In the challenging transition to college, I found balance in my academic and personal life through this LLC.
<br>
<br>The classes and experiences in the  LLC challenged me to think outside of the box. With the opportunity to explore and try new things, I learned a great deal about myself and the impact I can have on the business wolrd. Being a part of this group gave me new perspective in navigating my career and charting my own path.

### Gamma Phi Beta Sorority
<i>January 2022 - June 2025</i>
<br>
<br>When I entered college, I knew I wanted to find a community similar to what I felt in high school playing soccer and basketball. Joining Gamma Phi Beta sorority helped me find a supportive sisterhood where I knew I could be myself. The sorority's focus on community, leadership, and service aligned with my values, providing a sense of belonging and a space to grow.

As part of my involvement, I also participated in Girls on the Run, where I worked with young girls to foster confidence, strength, and a positive self-image. Girls on the Run works to build strong girls by helping them train for and run a 5k race. I had the opportunity to run as a running buddy, where I partnered up with a girl to support her and run alongside her during the 5k. This experience deepened my understanding of empowerment and inspired me to support others in their journeys.

Through my time in Gamma Phi Beta and Girls on the Run, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of community, leadership, and personal growth. These experiences shaped my approach to building connections and striving to create a more collaborative and supportive environment. By fostering these connections, I believe we can create a space where everyone can thrive and succeed together.

### Internship: Comcast Business Inside Sales Team
<i>Summer 2024</i>
<br>
<br>During my internship as a Product Sales Support and Analytics Intern at Comcast, I was responsible for analyzing data and providing actionable recommendations to improve customer retention strategies. I worked closely with cross-functional teams, using data-driven insights to support decision-making processes. This role required a combination of technical and analytical skills, which I honed by working with various data tools and systems such as Tableau, Salesforce, and Excel.

Throughout the internship, I developed my ability to interpret complex data, identify trends, and present findings in a clear and concise manner to regional and divisional leaders. My work directly contributed to the optimization of sales strategies, helping the team improve the accuracy of data collection by 11%. The experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me valuable exposure to business processes and decision-making in a corporate environment.

This internship helped me refine my ability to work with data and communicate insights to drive business growth, which I continue to apply in my academic and professional pursuits.

### Database Project: Silhouette Collective
<i>Fall 2024</i>
<br>
<br>During my Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence class in Fall 2024, we was tasked with planning, designing, building, and programming aspects of an information management system using Microsoft Word, Visio, and Access. This included designing and accessing a relational database, simulating data, building the relational database, loading the data into the database, querying the database using SQL, and developing reports based off of our analysis. We created dashboards in both Tabelau and Power BI to inform the company, Silhouette Collective, of their business metrics.

## Global Experience

Traveling has always been a very important part of my life since a young age. I first left the country alone at 10 years old, where I attended an international summer camp called CISV, which promoted peace among children of different cultures.
<br>
<br>When I entered college, I knew that studying abroad was something I wanted to take advantage of. I had the opportunity to study abroad in Sevilla, Spain during the fall quarter of my junior year in 2023.

<a name="GlobalCitizenship"></a>
### Exploring Global Citizenship
<i>Fall 2023</i>
<br>
<br>During my time studying abroad in Sevilla, Spain, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in both the language and culture. I took two Spanish language courses, which helped me improve my fluency, while also expanding my academic knowledge in international settings. In addition to the language classes, I enrolled in a government class, gaining insights into Spanish politics, and an international finance class, which offered a global perspective on financial systems. This experience not only enriched my academic understanding but also deepened my appreciation for diverse cultural and economic contexts.
<br>
<br>I also had the immersive experience of living in a homestay in Sevilla. Living with a Spanish family for 4 months allowed me to practice Spanish in a real-world setting, enhance my cultural understanding, and build meaningful relationships with my host family. Living with them gave me a deeper connection to the local culture, traditions, and daily life, which enriched my overall study abroad experience.
<br>
<br>While studying abroad, I had the incredible opportunity to travel to eight countries across Europe and Africa, including Portugal, Morocco, France, Italy, England, Scotland, Ireland, and Switzerland. Exploring these diverse regions allowed me to experience different cultures, histories, and perspectives, further enriching my global understanding and appreciation for international connections.
