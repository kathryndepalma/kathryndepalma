### Writing Samples
#### Good Urbanims: Ruby Hill Park
<i>Winter 2025</i>
<br>
<br>In this essay, I explored the concept of a utopian place around Denver, carefully examining its characteristics and envisioning its idealistic features. I translated complex ideas about urban development and community well-being into accessible language for a general audience. This process allowed me to refine my ability to synthesize and present intricate concepts in a way that resonates with readers outside of specialized fields. These skills are valuable in my technical analysis work and in communicating complex data effectuvily to non-technical audiences, ensuring that my insights can be understood and applied.

#### The Global Economy from a Structuralist Perspective
<i>Winter 2024</i>
<br>
<br>In this essay, I analyzed the global economy through a structuralist lens, focusing on how global economic systems and inequalities are shaped by historical and institutional structures. I worked to break down complex economic theories and present them in a way that is digestible for a broader audience. This helped me enhance my ability to communicate sophisticated economic concepts in simpler terms, a skill that is essential both in technical analysis and when explaining intricate subjects to individuals with varying levels of expertise.

### Innovation and Entrepreneurship Living and Learning Community
<i>Fall 2021 - Spring 2022</i>
<br>
<br>The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Living and Learning Community (LLC) is a group of first-year students living and taking academic classes together. I joined this community to help myself integrate into college with a group of people who have similar interests. In the challenging transition to college, I found balance in my academic and personal life through this LLC.
<br>
<br>The classes and experiences in the  LLC challenged me to think outside of the box. With the opportunity to explore and try new things, I learned a great deal about myself and the impact I can have on the business wolrd. Being a part of this group gave me new perspective in navigating my career and charting my own path.

### Gamma Phi Beta Sorority
<i>January 2022 - June 2025</i>
<br>
<br>When I entered college, I knew I wanted to find a community similar to what I felt in high school playing soccer and basketball. Joining Gamma Phi Beta sorority helped me find a supportive sisterhood where I knew I could be myself. The sorority's focus on community, leadership, and service aligned with my values, providing a sense of belonging and a space to grow.

As part of my involvement, I also participated in Girls on the Run, where I worked with young girls to foster confidence, strength, and a positive self-image. Girls on the Run works to build strong girls by helping them train for and run a 5k race. I had the opportunity to run as a running buddy, where I partnered up with a girl to support her and run alongside her during the 5k. This experience deepened my understanding of empowerment and inspired me to support others in their journeys.

Through my time in Gamma Phi Beta and Girls on the Run, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of community, leadership, and personal growth. These experiences shaped my approach to building connections and striving to create a more collaborative and supportive environment. By fostering these connections, I believe we can create a space where everyone can thrive and succeed together.

### Internship: Comcast Business Inside Sales Team
<i>Summer 2024</i>
<br>
<br>During my internship as a Product Sales Support and Analytics Intern at Comcast, I was responsible for analyzing data and providing actionable recommendations to improve customer retention strategies. I worked closely with cross-functional teams, using data-driven insights to support decision-making processes. This role required a combination of technical and analytical skills, which I honed by working with various data tools and systems such as Tableau, Salesforce, and Excel.

Throughout the internship, I developed my ability to interpret complex data, identify trends, and present findings in a clear and concise manner to regional and divisional leaders. My work directly contributed to the optimization of sales strategies, helping the team improve the accuracy of data collection by 11%. The experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me valuable exposure to business processes and decision-making in a corporate environment.

This internship helped me refine my ability to work with data and communicate insights to drive business growth, which I continue to apply in my academic and professional pursuits.

### Database Project: Silhouette Collective
<i>Fall 2024</i>
<br>
<br>During my Foundations or Information Management class in Winter 2021, I was tasked with planning, designing, building, and programming aspects of an information management system using Microsoft Word (documentation), Visio (diagraming), and Access (relational database). This included designing a relational database, simulating data, building the relational database in Access, loading the data into the relational database, querying the relational database using SQL, and developing relational database forms and reports, including using VBA macros, functions, and sub procedures.
<br>
<br><i>Spring 2021</i>
<br>
<br>During my Enterprise Information Management class in Spring 2021, I expanded this relational database, adding tables and moving it to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. This included designing, building, and programing an enterprise information management database using SQL Server and Azure; designing, building, and programing interactive forms using Visual Studio and SQL Server; and designing, building, and programing a Windows integrated application, along with reports, using Visual Studio and SQL Server. Throughout this process, I used SQL (build script, function, stored procedure, views, reports) and Visual Basic (forms).

### Database Project: Back to Roots OLAP
<i>Fall 2021</i>
<br>
<br>During my Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence class in Fall 2021, I used my Back to Roots OLTP to plan, design, and build an enterprise data mart (OLAP) using SQL Server, Visio, Visual Studio, Excel, and Power BI. Throughout this process, I created busienss requirements and designed the data mart; built the data mart; extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) the data mart; and developed reports and dashboards from the data mart to answer the the business requirements' questions.

### Automating Business Processes with VBA
<i>Winter 2021 - Spring 2022</i>
<br>
<br>In my Automating Business Processes class, I learned how to streamline processes and reduce repetitive work, specifically using VBA in Excel. After just a couple weeks, I realized the real impact this could have on the work I was doing for the Microsoft Office Certification Program. By automating repetitive, time-consuming tasks, my team and I could focus our energies elsewhere, like on maximizing support for TAs and students and growing the program.
<br>
<br>The repetitive task I identified and sought to automate was matching registrations for the certification exams against a list of students supposed to be registered for those exams. While it may seem trivial, this consumed unnecessary time and effort when completed manually, particularly given how frequently the task is completed. After understanding the process and goal, I designed and developed a solution to complete this task with the click of a button, and I added additional functionality, like error checking, to better meet our needs and even improve our work. Since its implementation, I have trained team members on how to use it, provided documentation, and maintained and improved it. This is just one example of identifying a problem and developing a solution, ultimately allowing our team to minimize repetitive work and maximize time and energies on student, staff, and program development.
<br>
<br>This project allowed me to develop my skill set, particularly related to coding and seeing a project through every phase of the development cycle including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, training, and maintenance.

## Global and Intercultural Competence

Traveling internationally and educating myself on cultures other than my own has always been a passion of mine. With that, I have traveled to thirteen countries with many opportunities to engage with locals, whether living with a host family in Spain or visiting a slum in India.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, my study abroad program to New Zealand was cancelled, and I did not have the opportunity to travel abroad in college. Nonetheless, I found opportunities at DU to expand by intercultural competence, practice inclusive excellence, and consider multiple perspectives. Further, I am planning a trip abroad for Summer 2022 to continue growing in these areas.

<a name="GlobalCitizenship"></a>
### Exploring Global Citizenship
<i>Fall 2019</i>
<br>
<br>Although my study abroad program was cancelled, I took a class on Exploring Global Citizenship in preparation of going abroad. This course helped me examine how my own culture and identity may interact with other cultures. Specifically, I examined how historical events, political climates, and social disparities surrounding privilege may influence others' views of and assumptions about me. Further, I educated myself on subtle cultural differences I may encounter, inlcluding differences in language and communication, approach to conflict, and cultural tendencies ([Hofstede's cultural dimensions](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/)).
<br>
<br>The awareness I developed in this course proved worthwhile beyond studying abroad, as it applies to my interactions with anyone whose background and experiences differ from my own. Recognizing and understanding cultural differences gives me an opportunity to reflect on the "why" of certain interactions and to begin understanding those interactions from the perspective of those with different cultural backgrounds than my own. This ability has the potential to help avoid miscommunications and to diffuse uncomfortable situations, which is valuable in any setting.

### International Business Exposure
<i>Winter 2021</i>
<br><br>During my International Martketing course, I explored the various dimensions of international marketing, particularly their affect on marketing strategies. In doing this, my peers and I developed a strategy to introduce a company's product line in a new country. This required understanding the products and identifying a market that would purchase them. In this process, political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal compatabilites between the product line and the new market were considered. Further, my team and I evaluated competition and the needed modifications, segmentation, targeting, and positioning for the product's success in the market.
<br>
<br>My key takeaways were the complexity of international business and the importance of taking time to learn about about other cultures. While our research provided valuable insight, it would be worthwhile to travel to the new market and engage in conversation.

### Connecting Across Worldviews
<i>Winter 2022</i>
<br>
<br>In my role as the TA Coordinator for the Microsoft Office Certification Program, I continuously seek opportunities to expand our team's skill set through personal and professional growth. One example of this is working with the Inclusion & Equity Education department at DU to bring our team a workshop on worldviews and connecting across them–a session valuable in learning to consider multiple perspectives. 
<br>
<br>Every day, I interact with people who have different beliefs, expectations, and values than my own, which results in different perceptions of the same experiences. This workshop helped me better understand what worldviews are, the role they play in my interactions with others, and how I can identify commonality to connect across them. One of my key takeaways was intent versus impact and how to navigate situations in which the intent of my actions does not match the impact. Further, it served as a reminder to regularly check my assumptions (and the assumptions others may have) and to ask questions with curiosity. Following this session, I was able to implement what we discussed to more productively understand and engage with others.

### Ethics Bootcamp
<i>Winter 2020</i>
<br>
<br>As part of my Ethics and Legal Studies class, I had the opportunity to partake in Ethics Bootcamp, where I attended a variety of sessions surrounding ethics and the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative Principles (integrity, trust, accountability, transparency, fairness, respect, rule of law, and viability). Two sessions I found most impactful were Considerations of Driverless Mobility by Professor Libbi Levine Segev and Fraud, Lies, and Hermes Ties by Aaron Beam.
<br>
<br>Driverless mobility is an interesting ethical dilemma, specifically in terms of the code behind it. Developers make decisions when writing the cars' code that impact the livelihood of the driver and their surroundings, including other people. For example, if a crash is inevitable, who or what will be protected by the car–and really by the coders behind the technology. Driverless mobility is just one of many ethical delimmas in the advancing technology space, and it poses interesting questions to be considered. This session got me thinkning about those questions and the broader implications, including the potential ethical considerations behind code I develop.
<br>
<br>Aaron Beam was co-founder and CFO of HealthSouth, and in his presentation, he shared the ethical dilemma he faced when his boss, Richard Scrushy, asked him to fix the numbers to prevent a drop in share price. Although recognizing it was wrong, Mr. Beam altered the numbers "just this once." Inevitably, this led to numerous instances of "cooking the books" until it eventually caught-up to him. My key takeaways from Mr. Beam's story is the courage it takes to act on doing right, rather than just knowing right versus wrong, and how small concessions can quickly lead to loosing oneself.
<br>
<br>Ethics Bootcamp was a rewarding and inspiring experience in collaborating with my peers to consider the role of ethics in our daily lives, and the key takeaways continue to resonate with me in the work I do and decisions I make.
